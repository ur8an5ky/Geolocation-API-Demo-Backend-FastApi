# Geolocation-API-Demo-Backend-FastApi
This is the backend of a project I am developing to test solutions to an open technical question in recruitment. It is a very basic version of an application for sharing photos of interesting places, with a location-based search function and a map for displaying content. Its main purpose is to test Geo-tools, which is why I am using FastAPI (rather than my preferred Django) in this version to simplify the work.
